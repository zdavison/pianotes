# Modes

Modes are often described in one of the two ways:

  * Constructing a major scale, starting on a different note of the sequence each time. (e.g Major: WWHWWWH, Dorian: WHWWWHW)
  * Relative to the major/minor scales, but with added flats (or in the case of Lydian, a #4).

Personally I find the latter more useful and easier to recall when in different keys, but it is also important to understand each mode is its own particular flavor / sound, rather than being a variant of the major scale. Historically, the modes are all as old as the major (Ionian) / minor(Dorian) scales, those two just happened to be the most popular.

## List Of Modes / Scales

Here is a list of all modes / scales I have personally found useful, and their degrees.

| Ionian ♭3 (Melodic Minor)   | `1 2 ♭3 4 5 6 7`                   |
