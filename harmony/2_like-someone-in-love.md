### Minor Scales (Reminder)
  * **Natural Minor**: `Major with b3, b6, b7` -> The natural minor scale, or Dorian with a minor 6th. 
  * **Harmonic Minor**: `Major with b3, b6` -> A version of the minor scale featuring a natural 7th, in order to provide access to a harmonic leading tone (maj7th). Often used when a V7 resolves to a minor chord, as the V7 features the natural 7th as its 3rd.
  * **Melodic Minor**: `Major with b3` -> Used to incorporate the leading tone (maj7th) when playing melody, note that this leading tone does not apply on the way down, so downwards we play the natural minor.

### Soloing

While you can solo in Eb over the entire tune just fine, here are some additional options and notes for each chord of the song. This is not exhaustive.

#### `Ebmaj7`
 * **Eb Major**: The key of the tune and scale of this chord.
 * **Eb Major Pentatonic**: Pentatonic version of Eb major.
 * **Eb Major Bebop**: Major scale with an additional chromatic passing note (#5/b6) in order to ensure chord tones land rhythmically on the downbeats.
 * **Eb Major Lydian**: Featuring a sharp 4, can be used for a specifically Lydian 'fantasy' sound and to break away from the norm a bit.

#### `G7/D`
  * **Mixolydian b6**: Mixolydian is the scale constructed from the dominant, featuring a b7. Here a b6 is added (Eb), as the natural E would clash with the Eb in the key of the tune.
  * **Dominant Diminished (H/W)**: Half-Whole diminished scale, works over essentially all dominant chords. 

#### `Cm7`
  * **Natural Minor**: Given this chord serves tonic function (as the vi), we can use the natural and harmonic minor.
  * **Harmonic Minor**: Given this chord serves tonic function (as the vi), we can use the natural and harmonic minor.

#### `Cm7/Bb`
  * **Natural Minor**: We can continue to use the natural minor we used for the `Cm7`.
  * ~~**Harmonic Minor**~~: We can't use the harmonic minor here as the natural 7th would clash with the Bb.
  * **Dorian**: We can use the Dorian scale here because the next chord is an `Am`, and Dorian features a natural A.

#### `Am7b5` (Half Diminished)
  * **Locrian**: As a rule, we can always use the Locrian scale over half diminished chords. In a minor scale, the ii chord is half diminished, and a Locrian scale built from this would share the same notes as the i chord. (here this would be `Gm`). Note that this `Am7b5` is the ii of a minor 2-5-1 progression. (The `Ab7#9` that follows is a tritone substitution of `D7`). [Still unsure how this then means Locrian makes sense here?]

#### `Ab7#9`
  * **Mixolydian #4** / **Lydian b7**: [Why?]
  * **Dominant Diminished (H/W)**: Half-Whole diminished scale, works over essentially all dominant chords. 

#### `Gm7`
  * **Melodic Minor**: Given this chord serves a subdominant function (as the ii of the `Gm/C7/Fm` 2-5-1 this is part of), we can nicely use the Melodic Minor and Dorian modes. [Why?]
  * **Dorian**: Given this chord serves a subdominant function (as the ii of the `Gm/C7/Fm` 2-5-1 this is part of), we can nicely use the Melodic Minor and Dorian modes. [Why?]

#### `C7b9`
  * **Dominant Diminished (H/W)**: Half-Whole diminished scale, works over essentially all dominant chords. 
  * **Mixolydian b6**: [Why?]
