### Overview

The core of the idea is to have a chromatically ascending bassline (E,F,Gb,G,Ab,A,Bb), and then to harmonize chords ontop of it.

The harmony itself functions as follows:

* `Ebmaj7`: The tonic of the progression.
* `Fm11`: A subdominant chord, with an added 4th/11th for color.
* [`Gb69`](#`Gb69`): The bIII, can work in a lot of 'bluesy' sounding progressions. 
* `Gm11`: The iii, a mediant chord, can be considered either tonic/dominant.
* `Fm7`: The same subdominant as `Fm11`.
* `F7`: Borrowed subdominant chord from the minor `Eb` scale.
* `Bb`: The dominant of `Eb`.

### `Gb69`

The `Gb69` chord here is interesting as it is clearly the odd one out of the progression (`Gb` not being in the scale of `Eb`.).

Here it can be viewed as a `Gb69` chord, and makes the most sense written this way (and clearly has a '69' sound), but also derives from the `Gbdim` chord (`Gb,A,C,Eb`).

Try playing the same progression, but substituting a `Gbdim` chord for the `Gb69`, note that this also works pleasantly. In this context, it would be the `vii` of the next bass note, the `G`. In our progression, we play a `Gm11`, but try substituting a `G7` instead and note that it also works nicely.

Functionally, the `Gbdim` chord works as a dominant (`vii` chords are dominant function).

> Note: You can add a note 1 semitone below any fully diminished (4 note) chord note and get a 7b9 chord with your added note as the root. 

> e.g: `Gb,A,C,Eb` + `F` == `F7b9`
